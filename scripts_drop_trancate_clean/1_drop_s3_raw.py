One-Time MinIO Bucket Cleanup Script

This script deletes all objects from the `MINIO_RAW` bucket and then deletes the bucket itself.

Features:
- Lists and deletes all objects in the bucket
- Logs each deletion individually
- Deletes the bucket after clearing its contents
- Handles and logs S3-related client errors
